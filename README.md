# PointProjector

Standard raytracers are boring. This simple project fires a bunch of white particles out of a light source. When a particle hits a wall, the wall absorbs some of its colour depending on the wall's colour. A dot is then drawn at this location and the particle reflects off.

**Note:** If you're trying to learn about raytracers look elsewhere. Do not do this, this is just for fun.
