⚠️ **This is a joke repo. It's not physically accurate and literally makes no sense. If you're trying to learn about path tracing then look elsewhere. Do not do this.**

Standard raytracers are boring. This simple project fires a bunch of white particles out of a light source. When a particle hits a wall, the wall absorbs some of its colour depending on the wall's colour. A dot is then drawn at this location and the particle reflects off.


## Usage

1. Clone this repo,
2. `npm install`,
3. `npm run dev`,
4. Open `localhost:8080`
